                            <b>Some of you,</b> particularly those coming from Alaska, might think, <i>holy moly, this is happening in AFRICA?</i>  In fact, this wedding will take place in South Africa, which is one of the only logically named countries in the world.  If every place had a name that was as informative as South Africa, Max wouldn't be lost all the time!  Max has some suggestions for new names for places e.g., <s>Canada</s> North North America, <s>China</s> Middle Asia, and <s>Antarctica</s> South World.  But back to the issue at hand: AFRICA.  You can see lots of beautiful photos of South Africa <a href="https://www.instagram.com/southafrica">on this Instagram page</a>, and these photos are important because they will convince you to come to our wedding so you, too, can see lions etc.

                            Public transit in Africa is nonexistent so, we highly recommend renting your <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/573p5A9IdPFN9Kqiqs6hlO?si=b8787ab1b99545d6">dream truck</a> for the duration of your stay, e.g., <a href="http://www.kwendasafari.co.za/index.html">here</a>.

                            <b>Where to stay:</b> Olwandle Estate is roughly 15m outside of both Ballito and Salt Rock.  Both are adorable surfing towns chalk full of delicious food, beautiful beaches, and lots to do.  We recommend you stay in either of these towns and rent a car so you can explore the other as well as attend the wedding.
                            We recommend <a href="https://www.petiteprovence.co.za/">Petite Province B&B</a>,
                            <a href="https://www.saltrockbeach.co.za/">Salt Rock Hotel</a> (the website doesn't always work on the first try, just FYI), or <a href="https://www.thecanelands.co.za/">Canelands Beach Club</a>.  Notably, the Salt Rock Hotel has excellent curry.  All of these options are right on the beach and highly accessible with great food nearby.

                            <b>Travel:</b>  For foreign visitors (that means you, Americans) we suggest flying into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Shaka_International_Airport">King Shaka International Airport</a>.<a href="#footnote-1">¹</a>  It's 15 minutes from Ballito.

                        Things that we recommend doing include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>walking or running the Ballito beach boardwalk;</li>
                                <li>grabbing breakfast or lunch at the Waterberries cafe;</li>
                                <li>for the exercise enthusiasts, renting mountain bikes or trail-running at Holla Trails;</li>
                                <li>early morning lap swims at Thompson's tidal pools;</li>
                                <li>eating at any of the restaurants or bars at the Lifestyle Center;</li>
                                <li>if you're up for a drive, hiking in the Drakensberg world heritage cite (2.5-3.5hrs away) which has endless hikes through beautiful mountains riddled with cute cottages where you can spend the night.</li>
                                <li>Additionally, if you have the time, we highly recommend visiting Cape Town (particularly if you can get there by driving the Garden Route), the Transkei, and Stallenbosch (particularly if you enjoy good wine and food).</li>

                            <b>Nearby game parks:</b>  You are in AFRICA so you should go do "safari".  A prime example would be going to a game park!  Here are some very cool nearby game parks which we recommend:
                            <ol>
                                <li><a href="https://www.nature-reserve.co.za/hluhluwe-imfolozi-wildlife-preserve.html">Imfolozi</a> and <a href="https://www.hluhluwegamereserve.com/">Hluhluwe</a>.  For Americans: they are both pronounced as if you are bowing your nose and using the restroom at once.  They are both about an hour away and you're highly likely to see the entire big five, modulo luck!  The primary difference is that ... nothing, these are the same thing, flip a coin to choose which one you go to.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><a href="https://www.andbeyond.com/destinations/africa/south-africa/kwazulu-natal/phinda-private-game-reserve/">Pinda</a>.  This park has walking adventures!  So, if your name is Cathy von Hippel, and you <i>cannot stay still</i>, this is the park for you!  The chefs and rangers are amazing, and we highly recommend it.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><a href="https://www.krugerpark.co.za/">Kruger.</a>  This is the biggest one by far ... it is 7,523 mi².  For reference, Connecticut is 5,018 mi².  So if you want so see some African critter it's probably in there.  On the other hand, this is the most popular game park by far, so for a more niche experience, we recommend the other ones.</li>
                            </ol>
